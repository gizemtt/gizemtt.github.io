    <section id="about">
        <p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.me.utexas.edu/about/facts-rankings" target="_blank">Operations Research and Industrial Engineering Program</a> within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, where I focus on stochastic integer programming and data-driven decision-making.</p>

        <p>My research is dedicated to enhancing the resilience of power grids and healthcare networks, with a particular emphasis on social equity in the face of natural disasters. I’m fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/hasenbein/" target="_blank">Prof. John J. Hasenbein</a> and <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/erhan/" target="_blank">Prof. Erhan Kutanoglu</a>. You can find my publications <a href="assets/Toplu_Tutay_CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>I've received funding from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1940308" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>, the <a href="https://ic2.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">IC<sup>2</sup> Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://ceo.beg.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Bureau of Economic Geology</a>. Additionally, I was awarded a <a href="https://gradschool.utexas.edu/funding/fellowships/grad-school/continuing" target="_blank">$52K University Graduate Continuing Fellowship</a> in recognition of my accomplishments since entering graduate school. These opportunities have allowed me to: (1) gain valuable experience in applying for and securing awards and grants, (2) work on research topics both assigned to me and self-initiated, and (3) collaborate effectively with team members from diverse fields, including economics, public policy, geosciences, electrical and computer engineering, and, of course, operations research. As a result, I have developed an interdisciplinary approach to research.</p>

        <p>I earned my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering with highest honors (<em>summa cum laude</em>) from <a href="https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index" target="_blank">Bogazici University</a>. Before beginning my Ph.D., I gained six years of industry experience—three years in the power sector and three years in manufacturing and logistics.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy walking, rowing, and experimenting in the kitchen to put my own twist on dishes—though not every experiment is a success! I also love to unwind with a picnic in nature, surrounded by family and friends.</p>
